## Status

Originally this library tried to unify the interfaces between multiple exchanges.
This goal has been abandoned until at least all of the API wrappers are refined.
There is a limited amount of common ground across APIs and data structures,
although a basic buy, sell and cancel could be unified.

### C2CX

API Docs: https://api.c2cx.com

The C2CX API wrapper is nearly complete. A few endpoints are unimplemented.
Their documentation is not accurate, corrections are noted in [exchange/c2cx/c2cx.go](exchange/c2cx/c2cx.go).

### Cryptopia

API Docs:

* Public https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Forum/Thread/255
* Private https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Forum/Thread/256

The Cryptopia wrapper has not been reviewed or tested since restructuring this library.
If someone wishes to use it, it would need a full review and cleanup of the data types.


## Integration Tests

To run the integration tests for the C2CX API:
1. Obtain a [C2CX account](https://www.c2cx.com) and deposit at least 1.2 SKY.
2. Create an [API key](https://www.c2cx.com/in/myaccount/api)
3. Set the environment variables `C2CX_TEST_KEY` and `C2CX_TEST_SECRET` to the key/secret from step 2.
4. Run `make test`.

Example:

```sh
C2CX_TEST_KEY=ABABABAB-ABAB-ABAB-ABAB-ABABABABABAB C2CX_TEST_SECRET=CDCDCDCD-CDCD-CDCD-CDCD-CDCDCDCDCDCD make test
```

The tests test (among other things) placing orders, retrieving orders and canceling orders.

The tests will place an order to sell 1.2 SKY at a rate of 0.5 BTC/SKY. Then it will test retrieving the order information. Then it will cancel the order.

Since we probably won't hit 0.5 BTC/SKY anytime soon, there's not much concern about losing any funds.
However, if the tests fail halfway, you may need to [manually cancel orders in C2CX](https://www.c2cx.com/in/orders) to run the tests again.
